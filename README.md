LOG IN PROGRAM IN JAVA
The programe has is a Java dependant system that uses a frame work with the SRC folder containing four files;
-App/main file
-Log in file
-welcome screen file
-userID and password storage file
The main/app file initializes the programe and navigates the user to the log in page, the log in page has multiple lines each with a specific use. On this page the user will find the the username and password slots where they can add in their user names and password and then tap the log in button leading to the welcome page if sucessful. The login file conatins lines of code with comments from loginbutton(variable) to lables and functions that create these options the user can interact witt. There are a couple of comments to also explain the function behind each amalgam of codes. 

The app/program is a CRUD and thus does not have a back end nore any form of database, for this reason in the useridandpassword file, there are fixed lines of strings that can be used to log in and are stored there. It is purely front end.
